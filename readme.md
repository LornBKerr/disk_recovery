**Disk Recovery**

A simple minded program to (_hopefull_y) recover some files from a crashed disk.

The backup drive crashed. Time for panic!!!

This happened to me. So, having lots of time (old and retired) and a
great reluctance to spend money an a (ideally) one time use program,
I wrote (am writing) this python program to see if I can recover anything.

**CAUTION: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.! NO WARRANTIES. NO GUARANTEES,**

**NO OBLIGATIONS ON MY PART.**

This program reads and writes raw sectors from/to the drive.
Admin rights are required.

The result of the crash ended up with a disk
that appeared to be total empty. It was visible to the directory listing
as an empty drive.

As I proceed through the program development, I will update this page.
